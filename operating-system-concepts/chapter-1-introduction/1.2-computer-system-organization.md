# 1.2 Computer-System Organization

## 1.2.1 computer system operation

### accessing shared memory

* CPUs and device controllers connected through a common bus that provides access to shared memory
* CPU and device controller can execute in parallel \(competing for memory cycles\)
* to ensure orderly access -- memory controller synchronizes access to the memory

### bootstrap program

* initial program to run
* stored within ROM or EEPROM \(firmware\)
* initialize all aspect of the system
  * from CPU register to device controllers to memory contents
* **must locate the operating system kernel and load it into memory to start executing the system**

### system process \(system daemons\)

* after kernel is loaded and executing, some services are provided outside of kernel --&gt; system process
* system process are loaded into memory at boot time & runs entire time the kernel is running

### interrupt \(hardware & software\)

* Hardware interrupt
  * triggered by sending signal to the CPU \(by system bus\)
* Software interrupt
  * triggered by **system call** \(monitor call\)
* interrupt vector
  * stored in low memory
  * array of address indexed by a unique device number, given with the interrupt request
  * array of pointers to interrupt routines that are predefined
  * provide the address of the interrupt service routine for the interrupting device
  * interrupt routine is called indirectly through this table
* when the cpu is interrupted....
  * stop what it is doing & immediately transfer execution to a fixed location
    * fixed location -- contains start address where service routine for interrupt
  * interrupt service routine executes and completed -&gt; CPU resumed previous interrupted computation



## 1.2.2 Storage Structure

### main memory

* known as rewritable memory / random-access memory \(RAM\)
* implemented in a semiconductor technology, called **dynamic random-access memory \(DRAM\)**
* CPU load instruction from main memory

### ROM : read-only memory

* can not be changed
* static programs are stored - ex\) bootstrap program

### EEPROM : electrically erasable programmable read-only memory

* can be changed, but can't be changed frequently
* mostly static programs are stored - ex\) smartphone's factory-installed programs

### load & store instruction

* load : moves a byte or word from main memory -&gt; to internal register within CPU
* store : moves contents from register -&gt; to main memory
* how instruction is executed \(_von Neumann architecture_\)
  1. fetch instruction from memory & stores it in the **instruction register**
  2. instruction is decoded
  3. fetch operands to be fetch from memory & stored in some internal register
  4. after instruction on the operands has been executed, result may be store back in memory

### secondary storage

* store large quantity of data permanently & extension of main memory
* why main memory can't reside data permanently 
  * main memory is too small
  * main memory is **volatile -** loses its contents ex\) when power is turned off 
* ex\) magnetic disk
  * most programs are stored on a disk until they are loaded into memory
  * use disk as source & destination of their processing

### storage system hierarchy

* higher \(expensive & fast\) ---------- lower \(cheap & slow\)
* **register &lt;&lt; cache &lt;&lt; main memory &lt;&lt; solid-state disk** &lt;&lt; magnetic disk &lt;&lt; optical disk &lt;&lt; magnetic tapes
* **semiconductor memory --??**
  * register, cache, main memory, solid-state disk are constructed using semiconductor memory
  * faster and cheaper
* volatile
  * loses its data \(ex. when power off, device remove\)
    * if there is only volatile memory, it will need expensive battery and generator backup system
  * register, cache, main memory
* non-volatile
  * safe to store data
  * solid-state disk,  magnetic disk, optical disk, magnetic tapes



## 1.2.3 I/O Structure

#### device controller

* CPUs and multiple device controllers are connected through a common bus
  * ex\) seven or more devices can be attached to the SCSI \(Small computer-system interface\) controller
* maintains some local buffer storage & set of special-purpose register
* responsible for moving the data btw **peripheral devices** & **local buffer storage**
* **device driver**
  * understands the device controller
  * provide the rest of the operating system with a uniform interface to the device

#### steps of interrupt-driven I/O

1. device driver loads appropriate registers within the device controller
2. device controller 
   1. examine the contents & determine what action to be take \(ex. read a character from keyboard\)
   2. starts data transfer from device ---&gt; to its local buffer
   3. \(after transfer completed\) informs the device driver by **interrupt** that it has finished
3. device driver returns control to the OS & return result of operation
   * operation "read" : return data or pointer to the data
   * other operations : return status information

#### DMA \(Direct Memory Access\)

* disadvantage of interrupt-driven I/O

  * can produce high overhead for bulk of data movement - ex. disk I/O
  * low speed compare to cpu clock speed
  * waste of cpu cycle - cpu should wait for I/O to be done
  * one interrupt per byte generated for low-speed device

* to solve this problem, DMA is used!

  * after setting up buffer, pointers, counter for I/O device, device controller **transfers an entire block** of data to or from its own buffer storage to memory without intervention by the CPU
  * Only one interrupt is generated per block
    * tell device driver that the operation is finished
  * CPU available to accomplish other work while device controller is performing

* steps of DMA
  1. CPU send I/O request to device \(device controller,\)
     * OS make program sleep and give controls? resources? to other program
  2. device controller\(DMA controller\) transfer blocks of data from buffer storage to memory \(and gets result from memory to buffer storage\)
  3. If operation is finished, device controller trigger interrupt and awake program to tell the I/O work is finished
     * CPU was working with other work while DMA I/O working, so no waste of cpu cycle~!
