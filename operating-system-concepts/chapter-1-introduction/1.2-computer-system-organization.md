# 1.2 Computer-System Organization

## 1.2.1 computer system operation

### accessing shared memory

* CPUs and device controllers connected through a common bus that provides access to shared memory
* CPU and device controller can execute in parallel \(competing for memory cycles\)
* to ensure orderly access -- memory controller synchronizes access to the memory

### bootstrap program

* initial program to run
* stored within ROM or EEPROM \(firmware\)
* initialize all aspect of the system
  * from CPU register to device controllers to memory contents
* **must locate the operating system kernel and load it into memory to start executing the system**

### system process \(system daemons\)

* after kernel is loaded and executing, some services are provided outside of kernel --&gt; system process
* system process are loaded into memory at boot time & runs entire time the kernel is running

### interrupt \(hardware & software\)

* Hardware interrupt
  * triggered by sending signal to the CPU \(by system bus\)
* Software interrupt
  * triggered by **system call** \(monitor call\)
* interrupt vector
  * stored in low memory
  * array of address indexed by a unique device number, given with the interrupt request
  * array of pointers to interrupt routines that are predefined
  * provide the address of the interrupt service routine for the interrupting device
  * interrupt routine is called indirectly through this table
* when the cpu is interrupted....
  * stop what it is doing & immediately transfer execution to a fixed location
    * fixed location -- contains start address where service routine for interrupt
  * interrupt service routine executes and completed -&gt; CPU resumed previous interrupted computation



## 1.2.2 Storage Structure

### main memory

* known as rewritable memory / random-access memory \(RAM\)
* implemented in a semiconductor technology, called **dynamic random-access memory \(DRAM\)**
* CPU load instruction from main memory

### ROM : read-only memory

* can not be changed
* static programs are stored - ex\) bootstrap program

### EEPROM : electrically erasable programmable read-only memory

* can be changed, but can't be changed frequently
* mostly static programs are stored - ex\) smartphone's factory-installed programs

### load & store instruction

* load : moves a byte or word from main memory -&gt; to internal register within CPU
* store : moves contents from register -&gt; to main memory
* how instruction is executed \(_von Neumann architecture_\)
  1. fetch instruction from memory & stores it in the **instruction register**
  2. instruction is decoded
  3. fetch operands to be fetch from memory & stored in some internal register
  4. after instruction on the operands has been executed, result may be store back in memory

### secondary storage

* store large quantity of data permanently & extension of main memory
* why main memory can't reside data permanently 
  * main memory is too small
  * main memory is **volatile -** loses its contents ex\) when power is turned off 
* ex\) magnetic disk
  * most programs are stored on a disk until they are loaded into memory
  * use disk as source & destination of their processing

### storage system hierarchy

* higher \(expensive & fast\) ---------- lower \(cheap & slow\)
* **register &lt;&lt; cache &lt;&lt; main memory &lt;&lt; solid-state disk** &lt;&lt; magnetic disk &lt;&lt; optical disk &lt;&lt; magnetic tapes
* **semiconductor memory --??**
  * register, cache, main memory, solid-state disk are constructed using semiconductor memory
  * faster and cheaper
* volatile
  * loses its data \(ex. when power off, device remove\)
    * if there is only volatile memory, it will need expensive battery and generator backup system
  * register, cache, main memory
* non-volatile
  * safe to store data
  * solid-state disk,  magnetic disk, optical disk, magnetic tapes
