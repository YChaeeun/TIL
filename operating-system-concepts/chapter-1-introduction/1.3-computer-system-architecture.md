# 1.3 Computer-System Architecture

## 1.3.1 Single-Processor Systems

* only one main CPU capable of executing **a general-purpose instruction set**
  * including instructions from user processes
* single-processor system has _**special-purpose processors**_

  * ex\) dis, keyboard, graphics controller
  * on mainframes, they may come in the form of more general-purpose processors ex\) I/O processors
  * runs limited instruction set & do not run user process
  * OS **can not** communicate with these processors
    * they do their job autonomously
    * thus, **use of special-purpose processor doesn't mean multiprocessor**

## 1.3.2 Multiprocessor Systems

known as **parallel system** or **multicore systems**

* have two or more processors in close communication
* processors share...

  * computer bus
  * clock \(sometimes..\)
  * memory
  * peripheral devices

#### advantages of multiprocessor system

1. Increased throughput
   * more work done in less time
2. Economy of scale
3. Increased reliability
