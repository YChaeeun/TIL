# 1.3 Computer-System Architecture

## 1.3.1 Single-Processor Systems

* only one main CPU capable of executing **a general-purpose instruction set**
  * including instructions from user processes
* single-processor system has _**special-purpose processors**_

  * ex\) dis, keyboard, graphics controller
  * on mainframes, they may come in the form of more general-purpose processors ex\) I/O processors
  * runs limited instruction set & do not run user process
  * OS **can not** communicate with these processors
    * they do their job autonomously
    * thus, **use of special-purpose processor doesn't mean multiprocessor**

## 1.3.2 Multiprocessor Systems

known as **parallel system** or **multicore systems**

* have two or more processors in close communication
* processors share...

  * computer bus
  * clock \(sometimes..\)
  * memory
  * peripheral devices

### advantages of multiprocessor system

1. **Increased throughput**
   * more work done in less time
   * N processor -&gt; speed-up ratio will be less than N
     * should consider certain amount of overhead
     * ex\) N programmers can not produce N times the amount of a single programmer produce
2. **Economy of scale**
   * less cost than multiple single processor systems
   * because multiprocessor share peripherals, mass storage, power supplies...
3. **Increased reliability**
   * if one processor fails, other processors can run its job instead
   * entire system runs only 10 percent slower, rather than failing all jobs in a failing processor
   * _graceful degradation_
     * ability to continue providing service proportional to the level of surviving hardware
   * _fault tolerant_
     * beyond graceful degradation
     * suffer failure but still continue operation
     * requires mechanism to detect failure, diagnose and corrected

### two types of today's multiple-processor system

1. asymmetric multiprocessing
   * each processor is assigned a specific task
   * **boss-worker relationship**
     * **boss** processor controls the system & schedules and allocates work to the **worker** processor
2. symmetric multiprocessing \(SMP\)
   * most common
   * each processor performs all tasks within the operating system
   * **peer relationship**
     * each processor has its own set of register, private cache & share physical memory
     * many processors can run simultaneously without significant deteriorate of performance \(N-processor if N CPUs\)
     * must carefully control I/O to ensure data to reach appropriate processor
