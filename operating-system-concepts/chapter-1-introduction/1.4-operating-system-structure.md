# 1.4 Operating-System Structure

### Operating Systems

* provides the environment within which programs are executed
* have ability to **multiprogram**

## MultiProgramming

* increase CPU utilization by organizing jobs\(code, data\) so that the CPU always has one to execute
* provides environment in which the various system resources \(ex. CPU, memory, peripheral device\) are utilized effectively
  * but they **do not provide for user interaction** with the computer system
* how?
  * os keeps several jobs in memory simultaneously, initially on the disk in the **job pool**
    * job pool : consist of **all processes residing on disk** awaiting to be allocated in main memory \(main memory is too small\)
  *  os picks and begins to execute one of the job in memory
  * if non-multiprogrammed system
    * CPU would sit idle waiting some jobs to be finished \(ex. I/O operation\)
  * if multiprogrammed system
    * doesn't wait for the long term jobs to be finished, rather **switches to and execute another job**
    * keep CPU busy

### Time sharing \(multitasking\)

* logical extension of multiprogramming
* CPU executes multiple jobs by switching among them, but the switches occur so frequently that the **users can interact** with each program while it is running
* **interactive** computer system
  * response time should be _short_ \(typically less than one second\)
  * switches rapidly so that user is given the impression that the entire computer is dedicated to his/her use, even though it is being shared among many users
